## Description
You don't have to manually add up the number of words for creating quotes anymore. This tool generates easy-to-paste tables for quotes from the analysis exported from memoQ.

You can also calculate the weighted words and the translation and proofreading time for the files. memoQ now [tells us the weighted words](https://www.memoq.com/memoq-build-june), but this tool is still useful in that it provides the estimated time.

This program is coded in Python with tkinter and is distributed in .exe format through [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/).

Japanese README will also be available upon request.

## Installation
This tool is currently only available for Windows at [Releases](https://github.com/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/releases).
Installer is now under development. In the meantime, please follow the steps below:

- Download dist.zip and decompress it
- Rename the folder to "easy_paste" or any name you like
- (Optional) Move the folder to C:\Program Files
- (Optional) Create a shortcut of the .exe file and add it to your Desktop, to your tools folder, or to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs (this way you can run the program from Windows Start Menu)

If you already have an old version installed, you only have to copy and overwrite the files and folders with newer dates.
This program needs to be **kept in the folder** to work. It does not work by itself.

If you have the Python environment installed, you can run the source code with `python(3) easy_paste.py` or `import easy_paste` even on Mac and on any OS.

## Usage

### memoQ analysis file types
Please select the following option when exporting the statistics from memoQ

- CSV (Per-file, Trados-compatible)

![Format](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/easy_paste_format.png)

### Generating a table

- You can open the program by double-clicking Easy Paste.exe or its alias.
- Choose a Trados-compatible CSV file exported from memoQ's statistics
- Click "Generate table for quote!"
- A CSV file starting with "to_paste" is generated in the same folder as the original CSV file

### Copying and pasting the table

- Open the exported CSV file
- You can easily copy and paste the table to your quote
- Paste with "Keep Text Only" option in order to avoid messing up the font and the format

### Options

- You can choose the format from "New, Fuzzy, and 100% and Repetitions" or ""New, Fuzzy, 100%, and Repetitions""
- You can choose the heading from "New Words" or "Translation -  New Words." I will add an option to create your own heading formats

![Four heading formats](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/easy_paste_heading.png)

### Calculating weighted words
The basic procedure is the same as in 'Generating a table'

- Click "weighted words!"
- A CSV file starting with "weighted_" is generated in the same folder as the original CSV file
- Open the exported CSV file
- You can change the words per day and the result updates accordingly

## Features to come
### Working on
- Make the code more [readable](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596802293)
- Prepare the installer
- Prepare the icon
- Make the "Open files" dialog more useful
- Create your own heading formats

### Maybe later
- Save last used settings
- Open the CSV files from inside the program

### Features not coming
- Support HTML format to count characters. It turned out we can use word counts for Asian characters

Please [let me know](https://app.asana.com/-/share?s=132674863519245-jpqOgsUH4HdnKpFhvDDKXHfGUw0ccrb27xIIYgXyXV0-29199191293549) if you need any of the features as soon as possible.
