## Description
You don't have to manually add up the number of words for creating quotes anymore. This tool generates easy-to-paste tables for quotes from the analysis exported from memoQ.

You can also calculate the weighted words and the translation and proofreading time for the files. memoQ now [tells us the weighted words](https://www.memoq.com/memoq-build-june), but this tool is still useful in that it provides the estimated time.

This program is coded in Python with tkinter and is distributed in .exe format through [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/).

The icon was created with [アイコン ウィザード](http://freewareplace.web.fc2.com/) and the installer is created with [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).

Japanese README will also be available upon request.

## Installation
This tool is currently only available for Windows at [Releases](https://github.com/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/releases).

All you have to do for installation and upgrading is to download and run the installer.

This program needs to be **kept in the folder** to work. It does not work by itself.

If you have the Python environment installed, you can run the source code with `python(3) easy_paste.py` or `import easy_paste` even on Mac and on any OS.

## Usage

### memoQ analysis file types
Please select one of the following options when exporting the statistics from memoQ

From Documents tab > Statistics:
- CSV (Per-file, Trados-compatible)
- CSV (Per-file, all information)

![Format](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/easy_paste_format.png)

From Project home > Overview > Reports > Analysis:
- CSV file exported by clicking 'export'

![Format](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/easy_paste_format2.png)

### Generating a table

- You can open the program by double-clicking Easy Paste.exe or its alias.
- Choose a CSV file exported from memoQ's statistics in above mentioned format
- Click "Generate table for quote!"
- A CSV file starting with "to_paste" is generated in the same folder as the original CSV file

![UI](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/easy_paste_ui.png)

### Copying and pasting the table

- Open the exported CSV file
- You can easily copy and paste the table to your quote
- Paste with "Keep Text Only" option in order to avoid messing up the font and the format

### Options

- You can choose the unit from "Word" or "Character." "Character" is only supported in all information CSV files or CSV files exported from "Reports." See [memoQ analysis file types](https://github.com/ShunSakurai/easy_paste#memoq-analysis-file-types) for details
- You can choose the format from "New, Fuzzy, and 100% and Repetitions" or ""New, Fuzzy, 100%, and Repetitions""
- You can choose the heading from "New Words" or "Translation -  New Words." I will add an option to create your own heading formats

![Four heading formats](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/easy_paste_heading.png)

### Calculating weighted words
The basic procedure is the same as in 'Generating a table'

- Click "weighted words!"
- A CSV file starting with "weighted_" is generated in the same folder as the original CSV file
- Open the exported CSV file
- You can change the words per day and the result updates accordingly
- Beware that the time and weighted words are not rounded. Round the values if necessary using Excel's commands, etc.
- You can choose the format from the following two formats

## Features to come
### Working on
- Make the code more [readable](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596802293)
- Make the "Open files" dialog more useful
- Create your own heading formats

### Maybe later
- Save last used settings
- Open the CSV files from inside the program

### Features not coming
- Support HTML format to count characters. It turned out some CSV formats include character counts
- Open multiple analysis CSV files at once. The equations will become too complex
- Append the results at the bottom instead of overwriting the existing file. The equations will become too complex

Please [let me know](https://app.asana.com/-/share?s=132674863519245-jpqOgsUH4HdnKpFhvDDKXHfGUw0ccrb27xIIYgXyXV0-29199191293549) if you need any of the features as soon as possible.
