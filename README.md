## Description
You don't have to manually add up the words for quotes anymore. This tool generates easy-to-paste tables for quotes from the analysis exported from memoQ.
This tool is coded in Python with tkinter and is distributed in .exe format thanks to [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/).

## Installation
This tool is currently only available for Windows at [Releases](https://github.com/ShunSakurai/easy_paste/releases).
Installer is now being developed. For the moment, please do the following:

- Download dist.zip and decompress it
- Rename the folder to "easy_paste" or any name you like
- Move it to C:\Program Files
- Create a shortcut of the .exe file and add it to your Desktop, to your tools folder, or to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs

When you use an updated version, you only have to move the files and folders with newer dates.
This program needs to be **kept in the folder** to work. It does not work by itself.

If you have Python environment installed, you can run the source code with `python(3) easy_paste.py` or `import easy_paste` even on Mac and on any OS.

## Usage

### Overview
You can open the program by double-clicking Easy Paste.exe or its alias.

- Choose a Trados-compatible CSV or html file exported from memoQ's statistics
- Currently only a CSV file is supported
- Click "Run!"

- Open the exported CSV file
- You can easily copy and paste the table to your quote
